# COURAGE data in CIDOC CRM

The COURAGE project includes historic data concerning people, organizations, cultural heritage collections, and collection items covering the period between 1950 and 1990 (http://cultural-opposition.eu/). This repository contains the results of translating the COURAGE dataset to CIDOC-CRM semantically. In addition, we provide samples for validating the converted dataset using SPARQL and SHACL.
